title: Next.js 13 with Firebase Hosting
tags: [nextjs, firebase]
---

Firebase [webframeworks](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/frameworks/nextjs) 
is currently in beta, and is missing some features.

To support nextjs 13's [app router](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/app-directory-roadmap) we can ignore webframeworks for now and use firebase hosting rewrites to route requests to cloud run. 
We will still want to use firebase hosting for serving static content to keep costs down.

## Build steps

Build your nextjs app for [cloud run deployments](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker) as per the docs. For firebase hosting simply copy the `.next/static/` to `out/_next/static/` to allow firebase hosting to serve static content. 

Your `package.json` should have a build script like this:
```
npm run build && cp -r .next/static/ out/_next/static
```

and a `firebase.json` with cloud run rewrites:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "out",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "/api/**",
        "run": {
          "serviceId": "star",
          "region": "europe-west1"
        }
      },
      {
        "source": "/**",
        "run": {
          "serviceId": "nextstar",
          "region": "europe-west1"
        }
      }
    ],
    "cleanUrls": true
  },
  "emulators": {
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5000,
      "host": "127.0.0.1"
    },
    "firestore": {
      "port": "8080",
      "host": "127.0.0.1"
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": true,
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 4000
    }
  }
}
```

Happy shipping!
